This module will prevent execution of your script by either dying or
deleting (unlinking) the script from disk after it is executed. This
can be useful if you have written a script for somebody that must
never be executed more than once. A database upgrade script for example.

The 'self destruct' mechanism can be achieved through deleting the
script so that it cannot be executed again, or by dying (terminating
the scripts execution).
